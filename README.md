# Christmass Lights v1
The first project in a three-part series of my first set of breadboard / Ardunio projects. Other repositories to come out later and will be updated as they come out.

The Arduino code can be found (here).

Hardware assembly instructions can be found (here). 

Happy breadboarding!!!
