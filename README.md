# Christmass Lights v1
The first project in a three-part series of my first set of breadboard / Ardunio projects. Other repositories to come out later and will be updated as they come out.

The Arduino code can be found here: https://github.com/Dang3r0us/christmass-lights-v1/blob/main/Xmas_Lights_v1.ino

Hardware assembly instructions can be found (here). 

Happy breadboarding!!!
